                <procdesc>The county boundaries were generated from the updated 1:24,000 scale Public Land Survey System (PLSS) grid by merging the PLSS polygons, which made up each county, into a single polygon.

The Platte - Buchannan county line was adjusted to a series of surveyed points that were based on a survey performed under contract with the Missouri Land Survey Program, August 18, 2003. Missouri Land Survey microfilm location - 165/1047 - 165/1048.

The Montgomery - Gasconade county line was adjusted based on the tax mapping from both counties and the use of aerial photography. There is a slight difference between the two counties with the discrepancy appearing to be where Quick Creek enters the Missouri river.</procdesc>
